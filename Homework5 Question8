** Program : hw5, q8
** Date Created : October 14 2013
** Date Last Modified : October 14, 2013
** Usage : No command line arguments
**
** Problem:
Extra credit (3%): Extend q6 above to get the lower and upper bounds for the range to
look for the prime numbers.




** Pseudocode:
** 1)Create variable for the number of prime numbers, and a variable for what each number will divide by
** 2)Run a for loop, this will be what runs through all numbers between user inputted lower bound and user inputted upper bound
        At the start of the loop, set prime to true
** 3)Nest a for loop, this will check whatever number the initial loop is on, by every number underneath it
** 4)For every number underneath, if there is no remainder, set prime to false
** 5)If theres a prime number, output the number, add one to count.
