**	Problem:

4) Write a program that inputs an integer that represents a length of time
in seconds.  The program should then output the number of hours, minutes,
and seconds that corresponds to that number of seconds.  For example, if
the user inputs 50391 total seconds then the program should output 13
hours, 59 minutes, and 51 seconds.


**	Pseudocode:
**	1)	Declare a variable for the number of seconds
**	2) 	Request user to insert the number of seconds
**	3) 	Calculate the number of hours, minutes, and seconds
**  4)  Display the total seconds, and its equivalent in hours, minutes, and seconds

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int totalseconds, seconds, minutes, hours;
	cout << "Insert the number of seconds for the program" << endl;
    cin >> totalseconds;
    seconds = totalseconds%60;
    minutes = totalseconds/60%60;
    hours = totalseconds/60/60;

    cout << totalseconds << " total seconds is equivalent to " << hours << " hours, " << minutes << " minutes, and " << seconds << " seconds.";
	return 0;
