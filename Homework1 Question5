**	Problem:

5) The workers have won a 7.6% pay increase, effective 6 months
 retroactively. This program is to accept the previous salary,
  then outputs the retroactive
pay due the employee, the new annual salary, and the new
 monthly salary.


**	Pseudocode:
**	1)	Declare a variable for the current annual salary, new annual salary, new monthly salary, and retroactive pay
**	2) 	Request user to insert the current annual salary
**	3) 	Calculate the new annual salary, new monthly salary, and retroactive pay
**  4)  Display the new annual salary, monthly salary and retroactive pay
